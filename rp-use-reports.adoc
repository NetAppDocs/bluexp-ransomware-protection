You can download reports that show details of protection, alerts, and recovery and save them as .CSV files. 

Before you download reports, you should refresh the data, which also refreshes data that will appear in the reports. 

You can download reports from any of the main menu options: 

* *Dashboard:* Report contains all summary information for all workloads. 
* *Protection*: Report contains the status and details of all workloads, including the total number protected and at risk. 
* *Alerts*: Report includes the status and details of all alerts, including the total number of alerts and automated Snapshots. 
* *Recovery*: Report includes the status and details of all workloads that need to be restored, including the total number of workloads marked "Restore needed", "In progress," "Restore failed" and "Successfully restored."

If you download reports from the Protection, Alerts, or Recovery page, the data in the report will show only the data on that page. 

The reports include data for all workloads on all BlueXP working environments.
