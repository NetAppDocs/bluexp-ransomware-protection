If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, an alert appears on the BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard indicating a potential ransomware attack. The service also immediately initiates taking a Snapshot copy. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

//If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, a notification appears in the BlueXP Notifications and an email is sent to the email address that you configured indicating a potential ransomware attack.  The service also immediately initiates taking a Snapshot. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

//You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  

//* If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

To begin to recover your data, mark the alert as ready for recovery so that your storage administrator can begin the recovery process. 

Each alert could have multiple incidents on different volumes with different statuses, so be sure to look at all incidents. 

The service provides information called _evidence_ about what caused the alert to be issued, such as the following: 

* File extensions were created or changed
* File creation occurred and increased by a listed percentage 
* File deletion occurred and increased by a listed percentage 

Evidence is based on information from Autonomous Ransomware Protection in ONTAP. For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^].

//An alert can have one of the following statuses: 

//* New alert
//* In progress alert
//* Active alert: A workload is active when it contains one or more incidents that are new or in progress.
//* Inactive alert: A workload is inactive when all incidents are marked ready for recovery or dismissed.

== Mark ransomware incidents as ready for recovery (after incidents are neutralized)

After you have mitigated the attack and are ready to recovery workloads, you should communicate with your storage admin that the data is ready for recovery so that they can start the recovery process.

. To initiate the workload recovery, select *Recover* workload in the message or select the *Recovery* tab. 

//== Dismiss incidents that are not potential attacks

//After you review incidents, you need to determine whether the incidents are potential attacks. If not, they can be dismissed.

//You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

//If you dismiss a workload, all Snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. 

//NOTE: If you dismiss an alert, you cannot change that status back to any other status. 

//.Steps
//. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*.

//. From the menu, select *Alerts*.
