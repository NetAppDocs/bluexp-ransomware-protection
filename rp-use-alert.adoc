If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, an alert appears on the BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard indicating a potential ransomware attack. The service also immediately initiates taking a Snapshot copy. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

//If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, a notification appears in the BlueXP Notifications and an email is sent to the email address that you configured indicating a potential ransomware attack.  The service also immediately initiates taking a Snapshot. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  

//* If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

To begin to recover your data, mark the alert as ready for recovery so that your storage administrator can begin the recovery process. 

Each alert could have multiple incidents on different volumes with different statuses, so be sure to look at all incidents. 

The service provides information called _evidence_ about what caused the alert to be issued, such as the following: 

* File extensions were created or changed
* File creation occurred and increased by a listed percentage 
* File deletion occurred and increased by a listed percentage 

Evidence is based on information from Autonomous Ransomware Protection in ONTAP. For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^].

The alert status is a summary of all the incidents in a single alert. The status is set to the highest ranking incident status. 

An alert can have one of the following statuses: 

* *New*: All incidents are marked "new" when they are first identified. You can also mark an incident as "new." 
* *In progress*: If you are actively working on mitigating the alert, you might want to change the status to "In progress" to let your team know. 
* *Completed*:If you have finished mitigating the alert, you might want to change the status to "Completed".
* *Dismissed*: If you suspect that the activity is not a ransomware attack, you can change the status to "Dismissed." 
+
CAUTION: After you dismiss an attack, you cannot change this back. If you dismiss a workload, all Snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted.

== Dismiss incidents that are not potential attacks

After you review incidents, you need to determine whether the incidents are potential attacks. If not, they can be dismissed.

You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

If you dismiss a workload, all Snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. 

CAUTION: If you dismiss an alert, you cannot change that status back to any other status and you cannot undo this change. 

.Steps
