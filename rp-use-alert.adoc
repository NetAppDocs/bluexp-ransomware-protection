[.lead]
When BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, it shows an alert on the Dashboard and in the Notifications area. The service immediately takes a snapshot. Review the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, a notification appears in the BlueXP Notifications and an email is sent to the email address that you configured indicating a potential ransomware attack. The service also immediately initiates a snapshot. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 


You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  

TIP: If you dismiss the alert, the service learns this behavior, associates it with normal operations, and doesn't initiate an alert on it again. 

To begin to recover your data, mark the alert as ready for recovery so that your storage administrator can begin the recovery process. 

Each alert might include multiple incidents on different volumes and statuses. Review all incidents.

The service provides information called _evidence_ about what caused the alert to be issued, such as the following: 

* File extensions were created or changed
* File creation with a comparison of detected versus expected rates 
* File deletion with a comparison of detected versus expected rates 
* When encryption is high, without file extension changes

An alert is classified as one of the following: 

* *Potential attack*: An alert occurs when Autonomous Ransomware Protection detects a new extension and the occurrence is repeated more than 20 times in the last 24 hours (default behavior).
* *Warning*: A warning occurs based on the following behaviors: 
** Detection of a new extension has not been identified before and the same behavior does not repeat enough times to declare it as an attack. 
** High entropy is observed. 
** File read, write, rename, or delete activity doubled compared to normal levels.

Evidence is based on information from Autonomous Ransomware Protection in ONTAP. For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^].

//The alert status is a summary of all the incidents in a single alert. The status is set to the highest ranking incident status. 


An alert can have one of the following statuses:

* *New* 
* *Inactive*

An alert incident can have one of the following states: 

* *New*: All incidents are marked "new" when they are first identified. 
* *Dismissed*: If you suspect that the activity is not a ransomware attack, you can change the status to "Dismissed."
+
CAUTION: After you dismiss an attack, you cannot change this back. If you dismiss a workload, all snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. 
* *Dismissing*: The incident is in the process of being dismissed. 
* *Resolved*: The incident has been fixed.
* *Auto Resolved*: For low priority alerts, the incident is automatically resolved if there has been no action taken on it within five days.

== Detect malicious activity and anomalous user behavior

Looking at the Alerts tab, you can identify whether there is malicious activity. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

*What details appear?*
The details that appear depend on how the alert was triggered:

* Triggered by the Autonomous Ransomware Protection feature in ONTAP. This detects malicious activity based on the behavior of the files in the volume.
* Triggered by Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security. This requires a license for Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security and that you enable it in BlueXP ransomware protection. This feature detects anomalous user behavior in your storage workloads and enables you to block that user from further access.
+
To enable Workload security in BlueXP ransomware protection, go to the *Settings* page and select the *Workload security connection* option.
+
For an overview of Data Infrastucture Insights Workload security, review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-infrastructure-insights/cs_intro.html[About Workload security^].

TIP: If you don't have a license for Data Infrastructure Workload security and don’t enable it in BlueXP ransomware protection, you won’t see the anomalous user behavior information. 

When malicious activity occurs, an alert is generated and an automated snapshot is taken. 

=== View malicious activity from Autonomous Ransomware Protection only

When Autonomous Ransomware Protection triggers an alert in BlueXP ransomware protection, you can view the following details:

* Entropy of incoming data
* Expected creation rate of new files compared to detected rate

== Mark ransomware incidents as ready for recovery (after incidents are neutralized)

After stopping the attack, notify your storage administrator that the data is ready so they can start recovery.

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*. 
+

. To initiate the workload recovery, select *Recover* workload in the message or select the *Recovery* tab. 

.Result

After the alert is marked for restore, the alert moves from the Alerts tab to the Recovery tab.  

== Dismiss incidents that are not potential attacks

After you review incidents, you need to determine whether the incidents are potential attacks. If the previous condition is not met, they can be dismissed.

You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  If you dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

If you dismiss a workload, all snapshot copies taken automatically in response to a potential ransomware attack are permanently deleted. 

CAUTION: If you dismiss an alert, you cannot change that status back to any other status and you cannot undo this change. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*. 
+
