If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, an alert appears on the BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard and in the BlueXP Notifications in the upper right indicating a potential ransomware attack. The service also immediately initiates taking a snapshot copy. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

//If BlueXP ransomware protection detects a possible attack, a notification appears in the BlueXP Notifications and an email is sent to the email address that you configured indicating a potential ransomware attack.  The service also immediately initiates taking a Snapshot. At this point, you should look at the potential risk in the BlueXP ransomware protection *Alerts* tab. 

You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  

TIP: If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

To begin to recover your data, mark the alert as ready for recovery so that your storage administrator can begin the recovery process. 

Each alert could have multiple incidents on different volumes with different statuses, so be sure to look at all incidents. 

The service provides information called _evidence_ about what caused the alert to be issued, such as the following: 

* File extensions were created or changed
* File creation occurred and increased by a listed percentage 
* File deletion occurred and increased by a listed percentage 

An alert is based on the following types of behavior: 

* *Potential attack*: An alert occurs when Autonomous Ransomware Protection detects a new extension and the occurrence is repeated more than 20 times in the last 24 hours (default behavior).
* *Warning*: A warning occurs based on the following behaviors: 
** Detection of a new extension has not been identified before and the same behavior does not repeat enough times to declare it as an attack. 
** High entropy is observed. 
** File read/write/rename/delete operations incurred a 100% surge in activity beyond the baseline. 

Evidence is based on information from Autonomous Ransomware Protection in ONTAP. For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^].

//The alert status is a summary of all the incidents in a single alert. The status is set to the highest ranking incident status. 


An alert can have one of the following statuses:

* *New* 
* *Inactive*

An alert incident is categorized in one of the following states: 

* *New*: All incidents are marked "new" when they are first identified. 
* *Dismissed*: If you suspect that the activity is not a ransomware attack, you can change the status to "Dismissed."
+
CAUTION: After you dismiss an attack, you cannot change this back. If you dismiss a workload, all Snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. 
* *Dismissing*: The incident is in the process of being dismissed. 
* *Resolved*: The incident has been mitigated.

== Detect malicious activity and anomalous user behavior

Looking at the Alerts tab, you can identify whether there is malicious activity. The details that appear depend on how the alert was triggered:

* Triggered by the Autonomous Ransomware Protection feature in ONTAP. This detects malicious activity based on the behavior of the files in the volume.
* Triggered by Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security. This requires a license for Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security and that you enable it in BlueXP ransomware protection. This feature detects anomalous user behavior in your storage workloads and enables you to block that user from further access.
+
To enable Workload Security in BlueXP ransomware protection, go to the *Settings* page and select the *Workload Security connection* option.
+
For an overview of Data Infrastucture Insights Workload Security, review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-infrastructure-insights/cs_intro.html[About Workload Security^]

TIP: If you don't have a license for Data Infrastructure Workload Security and don’t enable it in BlueXP ransomware protection, you won’t see the anomalous user behavior information. 

When malicious activity occurs, an alert is generated and an automated snapshot is taken. 

=== View malicious activity from Autonomous Ransomware Protection only

When Autonomous Ransomware Protection triggers an alert in BlueXP ransomware protection, you can view the following details:

* Entropy of incoming data
* Expected creation rate of new files compared to detected rate
* Expected deletion rate of files compared to detected rate
* Expected rename rate of files compared to detected rate

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*.

== Mark ransomware incidents as ready for recovery (after incidents are neutralized)

After you have mitigated the attack and are ready to recover workloads, you should communicate with your storage admin team that the data is ready for recovery so that they can start the recovery process. 

 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*. 
+
image:screen-alerts.png[Alerts page]

. In the Alerts page, select the alert. 
. Review the incidents in the alert.
+
image:screen-alerts-incidents3.png[Alert incidents page]

. If you determine that the incidents are ready for recovery, select *Mark restore needed*. 

. Confirm the action and select *Mark restore needed*. 

. To initiate the workload recovery, select *Recover* workload in the message or select the *Recovery* tab. 

.Result

After the alert is marked for restore, the alert moves from the Alerts tab to the Recovery tab.  

== Dismiss incidents that are not potential attacks

After you review incidents, you need to determine whether the incidents are potential attacks. If not, they can be dismissed.

You can dismiss false positives or decide to recover your data immediately.  If you decide to dismiss the alert, the service will learn this behavior and associate it with normal operations and not initiate an alert on such a behavior again. 

If you dismiss a workload, all Snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. 

CAUTION: If you dismiss an alert, you cannot change that status back to any other status and you cannot undo this change. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*. 
+
image:screen-alerts.png[Alerts page]

. In the Alerts page, select the alert.
+
image:screen-alerts-incidents2.png[Alert incidents page]

. Select one or more incidents. Or, select all incidents by selecting the Incident ID box at the top left of the table. 

. If you determine that the incident is not a threat, dismiss it as a false positive:  
+
* Select the incident. 
* Select the *Edit status* button above the table. 
+
image:screen-alerts-status-edit.png[Alert Edit Status page]

. From the Edit status box, select the *“Dismissed”* status. 
+
Additional information about the workload and which Snapshot copies will be deleted appears.

. Select *Save*.
+
The status on the incident or incidents changes to “Dismissed.” 

== View a list of impacted files

Before you restore an application workload at the file level, you can view a list of impacted files. You can access the Alerts page to download a list of impacted files. Then use the Recovery page to upload the list and choose which files to restore. 

.Steps

Use the Alerts page to retrieve the list of impacted files. 

TIP: If a volume has multiple alerts, you might need to download the CSV list of impacted files for each alert. 

//Alert tab -> Single alert -> Single incident -> Download file

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Alerts*.
. On the Alerts page, sort the results by workload to show the alerts for the application workload that you want to restore. 
. From the list of alerts for that workload, select an alert. 
. For that alert, select a single incident. 
+
