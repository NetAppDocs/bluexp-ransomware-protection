[.lead]
With BlueXP ransomware protection, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license.

You can use the following license types:

* Sign up for a 90-day free trial.
* Purchase a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.
* Bring your own license (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from your NetApp Sales Rep. You can use the license serial number to get the BYOL activated in BlueXP digital wallet.

//NOTE: BlueXP ransomware protection charges are based on provisioned capacity of datastores on the source site when there is at least one VM that has a replication plan. Capacity for a failed over datastore is not included in the capacity allowance. For a BYOL, if the data exceeds the allowed capacity, operations in the service are limited until you obtain an additional capacity license, upgrade the license in BlueXP digital wallet, or purchase a subscription in AWS. If you choose an AWS subscription, any capacity used above the contract limits is charged based on the AWS Marketplace plans. 


After you set up your BYOL or purchase a PAYGO subscription in AWS, you can see the license in the BlueXP digital wallet *Data service Licenses* tab or the active AWS subscription in the BlueXP digital wallet *Subscriptions* tab.

After the free trial ends or the license or AWS subscription expires, you can still do the following in the service:

* View workloads and workload health.
* Delete any resource, such as a workload or policy.
* Run all scheduled operations that were created during the trial period or under the license. 

== Try it out using a 90-day free trial
You can try BlueXP ransomware protection out by using a 90-day free trial. You must be an account administrator to start the free trial. 

NOTE: No capacity limits are enforced during the trial.  

You can get a license or subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the 90-day trial ends. To continue after the 90-day trial, you'll need to purchase a BYOL license or PAYGO AWS subscription. 

During the trial, you have full functionality.
