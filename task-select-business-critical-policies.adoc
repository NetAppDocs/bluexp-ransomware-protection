Business critical data policies identify the data that you consider as business critical for your company. Once you have defined these policies and activated them in Ransomware protection, the dashboard and other ransomware panels reflect potential issues based on your most important data.

You can display the _Business Critical Data Policies_ page by clicking on the *Business critical data* tab. You can also display this page from a link if you receive a Recommended Action for "Configure your business critical data".

Policy selection and changed selections affect the information showing in the dashboard, in the following panels: 

* Recommended actions 
* Business critical data immutability panel 
* Business critical data permission analysis panel 

== Select policies that identify your business critical data

The Business critical data page displays all of the policies that have been defined in Cloud Data Sense. This includes all of the predefined BlueXP policies and all of the custom policies that your organization has created. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-data-sense/task-org-private-data.html#controlling-your-data-using-policies[Learn more about Data Sense policies^].

If you know that one of the existing policies provides results that identify data that is critical for your business, you can select that policy. Just move the slider in the "Is critical" column to the right.

If you are unsure if the existing policy returns results that identify critical data, you can click the *Investigate* button to display the filters that are being used and the results of the policy in the Data Sense Investigation page.

Click *Create policy* to create a new policy

Click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[three dots button]> *Edit* if you want to edit the policy. The Data Sense Investigation page open so that you can customize the results using additional filters for the policy.
