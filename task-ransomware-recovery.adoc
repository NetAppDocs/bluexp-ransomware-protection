The BlueXP ransomware protection Recover Dashboard provides options for recovering data that may have been infected by ransomware. This helps you get your systems back up and running very quickly.

If the Ransomware Incidents panel in the BlueXP ransomware protection dashboard indicates that a volume, or volumes, have been infected by ransomware, you can click the *Recover* button to attempt to resolve the issue. 

At this time, the Ransomware Recover Dashboard enables you to replace the infected volume with a Snapshot copy that has not been affected by ransomware.

.Steps

. From the Ransomware Incidents panel, click *Recover* for a volume that has been infected by ransomware.
+
The Ransomware Recover Dashboard displays the volume name.

. Click *Display Snapshots* to view the list of available Snapshot copies for that volume.

. Select a Snapshot that has no encrypted data, and click *Recover*.
//. Select a Snapshot that has 100% clean data (no identifiable encrypted data), and click *Recover*.
//Add back 2 screenshots later too

. In the "Recover data from selected Snapshot" dialog, click *Yes* to recover the data from the Snapshot.
+
You can see the recovery status for the Snapshot, and you can see when the Snapshot has restored the corrupted volume.

.Result

The corrupted volume has been recovered by using a Snapshot that was created in the past. 

If the restore operation was done from a Snapshot that was not the most recent Snapshot, after restoration, all more recent Snapshot copies will be deleted from the ONTAP system because they are suspected of being corrupted as well (as shown in the screenshot above).
