== Add a backup destination

BlueXP ransomware protection can identify workloads that do not have any backups yet and also workloads that do not have any backup destinations assigned yet. 

To protect those workloads, you should add a backup destination. You can choose one of the following backup destinations: 

* NetApp StorageGRID
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)



You can add a backup destination based on a recommended action from the Dashboard.

// or from accessing the Settings option on the menu.

* *Provider settings*:
** Create a new bucket or bring your own bucket that will store the backups. 
** StorageGRID gateway node fully qualified domain name, port, StorageGRID access key and secret key credentials.

** The IPspace is the cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access. 

* *Backup lock*: Choose whether you want the service to protect backups from being modified or deleted. This option uses the NetApp DataLock technology. Each backup will be locked during the retention period, or for a minimum of 30 days, plus a buffer period of up to 14 days.  
+
CAUTION: If you configure the backup lock setting now, you cannot change the setting later after the backup destination is configured.

//** *Governance mode*: Specific users (with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission) can overwrite or delete protected files during the retention period. 
** *Compliance mode*: Users cannot overwrite or delete protected backup files during the retention period. 

. Select *Add*.

The new backup destination is added to the list of backup destinations.

+ 
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-s3-storage/task-add-s3-bucket.html[If you want to bring your own bucket, refer to Add S3 buckets^]. 

* *Encryption*: If you are creating a new S3 bucket, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. If you chose an existing bucket, encryption information is already available. 
+ 
Data in the bucket is encrypted with AWS-managed keys by default. You can continue to use AWS-managed keys, or you can manage the encryption of your data using your own keys. 

* *Networking*: Choose the IPspace and whether you'll be using a Private Endpoint. 
** The IPspace is the cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access. 
** Optionally, choose whether you'll use an AWS private endpoint (PrivateLink) that you previously configured. 
+
If you want to use AWS PrivateLink, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html[AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3^].

* *Backup lock*: Choose whether you want the service to protect backups from being modified or deleted. This option uses the NetApp DataLock technology. Each backup will be locked during the retention period, or for a minimum of 30 days, plus a buffer period of up to 14 days.
