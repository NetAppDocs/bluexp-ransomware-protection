You can configure a backup destination or enable threat detection by reviewing recommendations on the Dashboard. 

Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to a security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection.

== Add a backup destination

BlueXP ransomware protection can identify workloads that do not have any backups yet and also workloads that do not have any backup destinations assigned yet. 

To protect those workloads, you should add a backup destination. You can choose one of the following backup destinations: 

* NetApp StorageGRID
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure 



You can add a backup destination based on a recommended action from the Dashboard.

// or from accessing the Settings option on the menu.
