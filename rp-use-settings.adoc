[.lead]
You can configure backup destinations, enable threat detection, conduct an attack readiness drill, or configure connection to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security by accessing the *Settings* option. 


//You can also show future Preview features. 

//Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to a security and event management system (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR) server for threat analysis and detection. 

From the Settings page, you can do the following: 

* Simulate a ransomware attack by conducting a readiness drill and respond to a simulated ransomware alert. 
* Configure the connection to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security to see suspected user information in ransomware alerts.  
* Add a backup destination.
* Enable threat detection and connect your security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection. Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to your SIEM for threat analysis.   
//* Show upcoming Technology Preview features.

== Access the Settings page directly

You can easily access the Settings page from the Actions option near the top menu. 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. 
. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*.

== Simulate a ransomware attack by conducting a readiness drill

Conduct a ransomware readiness drill by simulating a ransomware attack on a newly created, sample workload. Then, investigate the simulated attack and recover the sample workload. You can run a ransomware readiness drill multiple times. 

TIP: Your real workload data will not be impacted. 

=== Configure a ransomware attack readiness drill

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* menu, in the Readiness drill card, select *Configure*.
+
The Configure readiness drill page appears.
+

. Select the BlueXP Connector that you want to use for the readiness drill.
. Select a test environment. 
. Select a new test workload. 

. Select *Save*.
+ 
A message appears that the readiness drill environment is configured. In that message, select *Start readiness drill* to start the drill.

=== Start a readiness drill 

After you configure the readiness drill, you can start the drill.

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection Settings menu, select *Start readiness drill*.
+
OR, from the Settings page, in the Readiness drill card, select *Start readiness drill*.

+
. Do one of the following:

* If you haven't already configured the readiness drill, a message appears that you first need to configure the readiness drill.
+
image:screen-settings-alert-drill-needtoconfigure.png[Settings page showing the readiness drill message that you need to configure the readiness drill]
+

+
image:screen-alerts-readiness.png[Alerts page showing the readiness drill alert]

. Select the incident with the "Readiness drill" indication. 
+
image:screen-alerts-readiness-incidents.png[Incident page showing the readiness drill alert]

. Review the alert details. 
+
Here are some things to look for:

* Look at the Potential attack Type. If the Type indicates that a user is suspected of malicious activity, review the user name. 
** You might want to block the user by selecting *Block user*. 
** You might also want to investigate the user more in Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security by selecting *Investigate in Workload security*. 



* Look at the file activity and suspected processes: 
** Look at the incoming detected data compared to the expected data. 
** Look at the creation rate of files that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the file renaming rate that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the deletion rate compared to the expected rate.

* Look at the list of impacted files. Look at the extensions that might be causing the attack. 
* Determine the impact and breadth of the attack by reviewing the number of impacted files and directories.

=== Restore the test workload

* Return to the Alert details page. 
* If the test workload should be restored, do the following: 
** Select *Mark restore needed*. 
** Review the confirmation, and select *Mark restore needed* in the confirmation box. 
* From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Recovery*. 
* Select the test workload that you want to restore.

+
The Recovery page shows the status of the Readiness drill restore as "In progress".

* After the restore is complete, the status of the workload changes to *Restored*.
* Review the restored workload. 

TIP: For details about the restore process, see link://rp-use-restore.html[Recover from a ransomware attack (after incidents are neutralized)].  

=== Change the Alerts status

After you have reviewed the readiness drill alert and restored the workload, you might want change the status of the alert.

* Return to the Alert details page.
* Select the alert again. 

* Indicate the status by selecting *Edit* and change the status to one of the following: 

** Dismissed: If you suspect that the activity is not a ransomware attack, change the status to Dismissed. 
+
IMPORTANT: After you dismiss an attack, you cannot chanage it back. If you dismiss a workload, all snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. If you dismiss the alert, the readiness drill is considered complete.
** In progress
** Resolved: The incident has been mitigated. 

=== Review reports on the readiness drill


. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Reports*.

//* *Backup lock*: Choose whether you want the service to protect backups from being modified or deleted. This option uses the NetApp DataLock technology. Each backup will be locked during the retention period, or for a minimum of 30 days, plus a buffer period of up to 14 days.  
//June 20, 2024 we do not support Azure and StorageGrid backup locking
//+
//CAUTION: If you configure the backup lock setting now, you cannot change the setting later after the backup destination is configured. 
//+
//** *Governance mode*: Specific users (with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission) can overwrite or delete protected files during the retention period. 
//** *Compliance mode*: Users cannot overwrite or delete protected backup files during the retention period.
