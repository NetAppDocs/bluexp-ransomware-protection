.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Listing block for input, space at beginning of line for output.

* Syntax uses a blank space at the beginning of the line for formatting.
* User entered command uses a "listing block" - code block with highlight and *Copy* button.  Uses [source,cli] syntax
* Output uses blank space at the beginning of the line for formatting.

== Command syntax to add the regex

The command syntax to add a custom regex is:

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s activate -n "<pattern_name>" -r "<regular_expression>"

* <pattern_name> = This is the name that will appear in the Data Sense UI.
* <regular_expression> = This can be any legal regular expression.

=== Example

The Product ID is a 12-digit number that starts with 201; so the regular expression is *\b201\d{9}\b*. And you want to the text in the Data Sense UI to identify this pattern as *Internal Product ID*. 

To see where your internal Product IDs are mentioned in all of your files, enter the following commands.

[source,cli]
[user Datasense]$ sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s activate -n "Internal Product ID" -r "\b201\d{9}\b"
