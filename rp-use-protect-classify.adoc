Within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you can use BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify your data on a file share workload. Classifying data helps you identify whether your data includes personal or private information, which can increase security risks. 

//TIP: This process impacts workload importance to help you ensure that you have the appropriate protection. 

=== Enable BlueXP classification 

Before you use BlueXP classification within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you need to enable BlueXP classification to scan your data. 

For details about BlueXP classification before you begin to use the service, it might be helpful to review these resources.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column.

. Review the information about BlueXP classification. 
. Select *Identify*. 

.Result
BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, connects remotely to your workload data, and scans the data in the NetApp cloud. Only the identified insights and metrics remain in the NetApp cloud; your data does not. 

NOTE: Scanning might take several minutes depending on the amount of data. The Protection page shows that BlueXP classification is identifying files and gives you an indication of the number of files it is scanning. 

When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column displays the exposure level, for example, High. 



=== Review the privacy exposure

After BlueXP classification scans for personally identifiable information (PII), you can look at the PII data risk. 

PII data can have one of the following privacy exposure risk statuses.  

* *High*: Greater than 70% of files have PII
* *Medium*: Greater than 30% and less than 70% of files have PII
* *Low*: Greater than 0 and less than 30% of files have PII

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+

. Select the workload link in the Workload column to see workload details.

. In the Workload details page, review the information in the Privacy exposure pane. 

=== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance.

| When privacy exposure: 
| From this privacy exposure
| To this privacy exposure
| Then, workload importance does this: 



.| *Decreases* | High, Medium, or Low | Medium, Low, or None | Remains the same

.3+| *Increases*  | None | Low |  Remains at Standard  
 |  Low | Medium | Changes from Standard to Important 
 | Low or Medium | High | Changes from Standard or Important to Critical
