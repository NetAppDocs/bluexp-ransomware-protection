BlueXP ransomware protection service lets you use BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify your data on a file share workload. Classifying data helps you find personally identifiable information (PII), which can increase security risks. 

//IMPORTANT: BlueXP classification can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud (non-SaaS deployments), or as a SaaS model in a technology Preview. When using non-SaaS deployments or existing deployments, scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is generally available and not in Preview. To turn on Preview features, use the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* option. Refer to link://rp-use-settings-html[Configure BlueXP ransomware protection settings].


TIP: This process can change how important a workload is, which helps you make sure you have the right protection. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

== Enable BlueXP classification 

Enable BlueXP classification to scan your data before using it in BlueXP ransomware protection.

//TIP: You do this only once; you don't have to enable BlueXP classification again if you choose another file share workload on which to identify exposure.

By using the BlueXP classification UI as an alternate method, an administrator can enable BlueXP classification in ransomware protection.

.Before you begin

Scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is available to customers who deployed BlueXP classification. BlueXP classification is available as part of the BlueXP platform at no extra charge and can be deployed on-premises or in the customer cloud.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column.

//+
//image:screen-protection-sensitive-data.png[Identify sensitive data screen]

//. Review the information about BlueXP classification. 
//. Select *Identify*. 

.Result

//For the SaaS version of BlueXP classification, BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, connects to your workload data, and scans it in the NetApp cloud (Amazon Web Services, us-west-1). Only the results and metrics stay in the NetApp cloud. 


Scanning might take several minutes, depending on data size. The Protection page shows the number of files being scanned.

When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column displays the exposure level as Low, Medium, or High.  



== Review the privacy exposure

After scanning for PII, review the PII data risk. 

PII data can have one of the following privacy exposure risk statuses.  

* *High*: Greater than 70% of files have PII
* *Medium*: Greater than 30% and less than 70% of files have PII
* *Low*: Greater than 0 and less than 30% of files have PII



.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+

//TIP: If the privacy exposure change affects the workload importance, an up or down arrow appears next to the Workload Importance status.  

== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance.
