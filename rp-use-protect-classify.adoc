Within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you can use BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify your data on a file share workload. Classifying data helps you identify whether your data includes personal or private information, which can increase security risks. This process also impacts workload priority and helps you ensure that you have the appropriate protection. 

=== Enable BlueXP classification 

Before you use BlueXP classification within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you need to enable BlueXP classification to scan your data. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column.

. Review the information about BlueXP classification. 
. Select *Identify*. 

.Result
BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, connects remotely to your workload data, and scans it in the NetApp cloud. Only the identified insights and metrics remain in the NetApp cloud; your data does not. 

The Protection page shows that BlueXP classification is identifying files and gives you an indication of the number of files it is scanning. 

=== Review the privacy exposure

After BlueXP classification scans for personally identifiable information (PII), you can look at the PII data risk. 

PII data can have one of the following risk statuses: 

* *High*: xnumber or more files with PII
* *Low*: 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column.
