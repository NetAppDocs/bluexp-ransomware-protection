Within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you can use BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify your data on a file share workload. Classifying data helps you identify whether your data includes personally identifiable information (PII), which can increase security risks. 

//IMPORTANT: BlueXP classification can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud (non-SaaS deployments), or as a SaaS model in a technology Preview. When using non-SaaS deployments or existing deployments, scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is generally available and not in Preview. To enable Preview features, use the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* option. Refer to link://rp-use-settings-html[Configure BlueXP ransomware protection settings].


TIP: This process can impact workload importance to help you ensure that you have the appropriate protection. 

== Enable BlueXP classification 

Before you use BlueXP classification within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you need to enable BlueXP classification to scan your data. 

//TIP: You do this only once; you don't have to enable BlueXP classification again if you choose another file share workload on which to identify exposure.

By using the BlueXP classification UI as an alternate method, an administrator can enable BlueXP classification in BlueXP ransomware protection. 

It might be helpful to review these BlueXP classification resources before you begin to use the service:

.Before you begin

Scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is available to customers who deployed BlueXP classification. BlueXP classification is available as part of the BlueXP platform at no extra charge and can be deployed on-premises or in the customer cloud.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column. 
+

. To enable BlueXP classification to scan your data for personally identifiable data, in the *Privacy exposure* column, select *Identify exposure*. 
//+
//image:screen-protection-sensitive-data.png[Identify sensitive data screen]

//. Review the information about BlueXP classification. 
//. Select *Identify*. 

.Result
//For the SaaS version of BlueXP classification, BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, remotely connects to your workload data and scans it in the NetApp cloud (Amazon Web Services, us-west-1). Only identified insights and metrics remain the the NetApp cloud. 

Scanning might take several minutes depending on the amount of data. The Protection page shows that BlueXP classification is identifying files and gives you an indication of the number of files it is scanning. 

When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column displays the exposure level as Low, Medium, or High.  



== Review the privacy exposure

After BlueXP classification scans for personally identifiable information (PII), you can look at the PII data risk. 

PII data can have one of the following privacy exposure risk statuses.  

* *High*: Greater than 70% of files have PII
* *Medium*: Greater than 30% and less than 70% of files have PII
* *Low*: Greater than 0 and less than 30% of files have PII



.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+

//+
//TIP: If the status changes, an up or down arrow appears in the Privacy exposure column to indicate the Privacy exposure change. 

. Select the workload link in the Workload column to see workload details. 
+

. In the Workload details page, review the information in the Privacy exposure tile. 
//+
//TIP: If the privacy exposure change affects the workload importance, an up or down arrow appears next to the Workload Importance status.  

== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance.
