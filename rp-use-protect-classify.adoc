Within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you can use BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify your data on a file share workload. Classifying data helps you identify whether your data includes personal or private information, which can increase security risks. 

TIP: This process impacts workload importance to help you ensure that you have the appropriate protection. 

=== Enable BlueXP classification 

Before you use BlueXP classification within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you need to enable BlueXP classification to scan your data.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/reference-private-data-categories.html[Categories of private data^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/task-investigate-data.html[Investigate the data stored in your organization^]

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column.

. To enable BlueXP classification to scan your data for sensitive data, in the Privacy exposure column, select *Identify exposure*.

. Review the information about BlueXP classification. 
. Select *Identify*. 

.Result
BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, connects remotely to your workload data, and scans the data in the NetApp cloud. Only the identified insights and metrics remain in the NetApp cloud; your data does not. 

NOTE: Scanning might take several minutes depending on the amount of data. 

The Protection page shows that BlueXP classification is identifying files and gives you an indication of the number of files it is scanning. 

When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column displays the exposure level, for example, High. 



=== Review the privacy exposure

After BlueXP classification scans for personally identifiable information (PII), you can look at the PII data risk. 

PII data can have one of the following risk statuses: 

* *High*: xnumber or more files with PII
* *Medium*: 
* *Low*: 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+

. Select the workload link in the Workload column to see workload details.

. In the Workload details page, review the information in the Privacy exposure pane. 

=== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance: 

* When the privacy exposure decreases from High, Medium, or Low, the workload importance does not change. 
* When the privacy exposure increases, the following occurs: 
** When privacy exposure increases from None to Low, the workload importance remains at Standard. 
** When privacy exposure increases from Low to Medium, the workload importance increases from Standard to Important. 
** When privacy exposure increases from Low or Medium to High, the workload importance increases from Standard or Important to Critical. 



== Investigate sensitive data directly in BlueXP classification


.Steps

. Select the workload in the Workload column to see its details.

. In the Workload details page, review the information in the Privacy exposure pane. 

. To investigate the exposure in BlueXP classification, select *Investigate*.
