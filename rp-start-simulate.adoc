Run a ransomware readiness drill by simulating an attack on a new sample workload. Investigate the simulated attack and recover the workload. Use this feature to test alert notifications, response, and recovery. Run the drill as often as needed.

TIP: Your real workload data is not impacted. 



== Configure a ransomware attack readiness drill
Before you run a simulation, set up a drill on the Settings page. Access the Settings page from the Actions option in the top menu.

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

. Do the following: 
.. Select the BlueXP Connector that you want to use for the readiness drill.
.. Select a test working environment. 
.. Select a test storage SVM. 
.. Enter the name of a new test workload to be created. Do not include dashes in the name. 

. Select *Save*.
//+ 
//A message appears that the readiness drill environment is configured. In that message, select *Start readiness drill* to start the drill.

After you configure the readiness drill, you can start the drill.

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

When you start the readiness drill, BlueXP ransomware protection skips the learning mode and starts the drill in active mode. The detection status of the workload is Active.

TIP: A workload can have a ransomware detection *Learning mode* status when a detection policy is recently assigned and the service scans workloads.

.Steps

//+
//** Select *Configure readiness drill test environment*. 
//** Continue with the instructions in the previous section to configure the drill test environment in the Settings option.

. If you already configured the readiness drill, after selecting *Start*, the readiness drill begins.

Here are some things to look for:

* Look at the Potential attack Type. 
+
If the Type indicates that a user is suspected of malicious activity, review the user name. You might want to investigate the user more in Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security by selecting *Investigate in Workload security*. 

//** You might want to block the user by selecting *Block user*. 

* Look at the file activity and suspected processes: 
** Look at the incoming detected data compared to the expected data. 
** Look at the creation rate of files that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the file renaming rate that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the deletion rate compared to the expected rate.

* Look at the list of impacted files. Look at the extensions that might be causing the attack. 
* Determine the impact and breadth of the attack by reviewing the number of impacted files and directories.

== Restore the test workload

After reviewing the readiness drill alert, restore the test workload if needed.

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

.Steps

** Review the confirmation, and select *Mark restore needed* in the confirmation box. 
* From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Recovery*. 
* Select the test workload marked with "Readiness drill" that you want to restore.
* Select *Restore*.

After the restore is complete, BlueXP changes the status of the workload to *Restored*.
. Review the restored workload. 

TIP: For details about the restore process, see link:rp-use-recover.html[Recover from a ransomware attack (after incidents are neutralized)].  

== Change the Alerts status after the readiness drill

After reviewing the readiness drill alert and restoring the workload, change the alert status if needed.

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].
