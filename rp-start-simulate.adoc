* Look at the Potential attack Type. If the Type indicates that a user is suspected of malicious activity, review the user name. 
** You might want to block the user by selecting *Block user*. 
** You might also want to investigate the user more in Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security by selecting *Investigate in Workload security*. 



* Look at the file activity and suspected processes: 
** Look at the incoming detected data compared to the expected data. 
** Look at the creation rate of files that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the file renaming rate that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the deletion rate compared to the expected rate.

* Look at the list of impacted files. Look at the extensions that might be causing the attack. 
* Determine the impact and breadth of the attack by reviewing the number of impacted files and directories.

== Restore the test workload

. Return to the Alert details page.
