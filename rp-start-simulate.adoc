Conduct a ransomware readiness drill by simulating a ransomware attack on a newly created, sample workload. Then, investigate the simulated attack and recover the sample workload. This feature helps you know that you are prepared in the event of an actual ransomware attack by testing alert notification, response, and recovery processes. You can run a ransomware readiness drill multiple times. 

TIP: Your real workload data will not be impacted.
