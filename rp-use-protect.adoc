You can protect workloads against ransomware attacks by completing the following actions using BlueXP ransomware protection. 

* View existing workload protection. 
* Assign a policy to a workload.
//* Change protection.
//** Increase application protection to prevent future RW attacks.
//** Change the protection for a workload that was previously protected in the RW service.
//* Manage policies (only the ones that you created).



BlueXP ransomware protection assigns a priority to each workload during discovery. The workload priority is determined by the following Snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *High*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per day but greater than 1 per hour
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per day 


A workload can have one of the following protection statuses:

* At risk
* Protected

A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and Snapshots have been completed. 
* *In progress*: Backups or Snapshot copies are in progress. 
* *Warning*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 
//* *Failed*: Backups or Snapshot copies have not completed successfully. 

== View workload ransomware protection 

One of the first steps in protecting workloads is viewing your current workloads and their protection status. You can see the following types of workloads: 

* Application workloads 
* VM workloads
* File share workloads


.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Do one of the following: 
+
* From the Dashboard Data Protection pane, select *View all*. 
* From the menu, select *Protect*.

. View different workloads: 
+
* To see application workloads, select the *Application workloads* tab. 
* To see file share workloads, select the *File share workloads* tab. 

. From this page, you can assign a policy to a workload.


== Assign a ransomware protection policy to workloads 

To help protect your data, you can assign an existing ransomware protection policy to one or more workloads. You can also assign a different policy to a workload that already has a policy.

BlueXP ransomware protection includes the following predefined policies that are aligned with workload priority:
