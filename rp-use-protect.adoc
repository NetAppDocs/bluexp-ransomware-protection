A workload can have one of the following protection statuses:

A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and Snapshots have been completed. 
* *In progress*: Backups or Snapshots are in progress. 
* *Warning*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 
* *Failed*: Backups or Snapshots have not completed successfully.
