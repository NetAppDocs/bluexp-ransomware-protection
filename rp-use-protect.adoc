You can protect workloads against ransomware attacks by completing the following actions using BlueXP ransomware protection. 

* View existing workload protection. 
* Assign a policy to a workload.
* Change protection.
** Increase application protection to prevent future RW attacks.
** Change the protection for a workload that was previously protected in the RW service.
* Manage policies (only the ones that you created).



BlueXP ransomware protection assigns a priority to each workload during discovery. The workload priority is determined by the following Snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *Important*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per day but greater than 1 per hour
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per day 


A workload can have one of the following protection statuses:

* At risk
* Protected

A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and Snapshots have been completed. 
* *In progress*: Backups or Snapshots are in progress. 
* *Warning*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 
* *Failed*: Backups or Snapshots have not completed successfully.

== Assign a ransomware protection policy to workloads 

To help protect your data, you can assign an existing ransomware protection policy to one or more workloads. You can also assign a different policy to a workload that already has a policy.

BlueXP ransomware protection includes the following predefined policies that are aligned with workload priority: 

* Critical workload policy 
* Important workload policy
* Workload policy
