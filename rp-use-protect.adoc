== Protection information 

The Protection page shows the following information about workload protection: 

*Protection status*: A workload can show one of the following protection statuses to indicate whether a policy is applied or not: 

* *Protected*: A policy is applied. 
* *At risk*: No policy is applied. 
* *In progress*: A policy is being applied but not completed yet. 
* *Failed*: A policy is applied but is not working. 

//*Protection health*: A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

//* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and Snapshot copies have been completed. 
//* *In progress*: Backups or Snapshot copies are in progress. 
//* *Failed*: Backups or Snapshot copies have not completed successfully. 
//* *N/A*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 

*Detection status*: A workload can have one of the following ransomware detection statuses: 

* *Learning*: A ransomware detection policy was recently assigned to the workload and the service is scanning workloads. 
* *Active*: A ransomware detection protection policy is assigned. 
* *Not set*: A ransomware detection protection policy is not assigned. 
* *Error*: A ransomware detection policy was assigned, but the service has encountered an error. 

*Detection policy*: The name of the ransomware detection policy appears, if one has been assigned. 

*Snapshot and backup policies*: This column shows the Snapshot and backup policies applied to the workload and the product or service that is managing those policies.  

* Managed by SnapCenter
* Managed by BlueXP backup and recovery
* Name of ransomware protection policy that governs Snapshots and backups
* None

=== Workload importance

BlueXP ransomware protection assigns an importance or priority to each workload during discovery based on an analysis of each workload. The workload importance is determined by the following Snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *High*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per day but greater than 1 per hour
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per day 

=== Predefined ransomware detection policies based on workload importance

You can choose one of the following BlueXP ransomware protection  predefined policies that are aligned with workload importance:

== View ransomware protection on a workload

One of the first steps in protecting workloads is viewing your current workloads and their protection status. You can see the following types of workloads: 

* Application workloads 
* VM workloads
* File share workloads


.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Do one of the following: 
+
* From the Data Protection pane on the Dashboard, select *View all*. 
* From the menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection-sc-columns.png[Protection page]
. From this page, you can view and change protection details for the workload.

//. To see file share workloads, select the *File share workloads* tab. 
// * To see application workloads, select the *Application workloads* tab. 

== Change workload protection details

You can change protection details such as the workload priority and name of the workload, if that workload is not managed by SnapCenter or BlueXP backup and recovery. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
+
image:screen-protection-details.png[Workload details from the Protection page]
+
From the workload details page, you can assign a policy to a workload, change a workload name or priority, view alerts, view backup destinations, and view recovery information.

. To change the name of a workload, click the *Pencil* image:button_pencil.png[Pencil] icon next to the workload name and change the name. 

. To change the importance of the workload from the assigned priority, click the *Pencil* image:button_pencil.png[Pencil] icon next to the workload priority and change it. 

. To view the policy associated with the workload, in the Protection pane of the Workload details page, click *View policy*. 

. To view workload backup destinations, in the Protection pane of the Workload details page, click the *View backup destination*.
+
A list of configured backup destinations appears. 
For details, see link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure protection settings].

== Enable application- or VM-consistent protection with SnapCenter

Enabling application- or VM-consistent protection helps you protect your application or VM workloads in a consistent manner, achieving a quiescent and consistent state to avoid potential data loss later if recovery is needed. 

This process initiates installing SnapCenter Software for applications or SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere for VMs. 

After you enable workload-consistent protection, you can manage protection strategies in BlueXP ransomware protection. The protection strategy includes the Snapshot and Backup policies managed elsewhere along with a ransomware detection policy managed in BlueXP ransomware protection. 

To learn about SnapCenter, refer to the following information:  

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/index.html[SnapCenter Software^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/index.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere^]

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
+
image:screen-protection-sc-columns.png[Protection page]

. On the Protection page, select the *Actions* image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[Actions button] option, and in the drop-down menu, select *Enable workload-consistent protection* to enable SnapCenter. 
+ 
TIP: If you chose a VM-based workload, the link to install SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere appears instead of "Install SnapCenter."
+
image:screen-protection-enable-sc.png[Enable workload-consistent protection page]

. In the Workload location field, select *Copy* to copy the workload location to the clipboard for use in the SnapCenter installation. Scroll down to see the remainder of the workload details. 

. Select *Install SnapCenter*. 
+
* If you selected an application-based workload, the SnapCenter Software information appears. 
* If you selected a VM-based workload, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere information appears. 

. Follow the information to install SnapCenter. 

. Return to BlueXP ransomware protection. Select *Protection* to view the Protection page. 

. Review details in the Snapshot and backup policies column on the Protection page to see that the policies are managed elsewhere. 

== Create a ransomware protection strategy (if you have no Snapshot or Backup policies)

If Snapshot or Backup policies do not exist on the workload, you can create a ransomware protection strategy, which can include the following policies: 

* Snapshot policy 
* Backup policy 
* Ransomware detection policy

With BlueXP ransomware protection, you can assign a ransomware protection strategy to workloads having policies that are managed by these other products and services: 

* BlueXP backup and recovery manages policies governing Snapshots, replications to secondary storage, and backups to object storage. 

* SnapCenter Software manages application-consistent Snapshots and backup protection policies. 

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere manages VM-consistent protection policies. 

.Steps to create a ransomware protection strategy 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection-sc-columns.png[Protection page]

. From the Protection page, select *Manage ransomware protection strategies*. 
+
image:screen-protection-strategy-manage.png[Manage strategy page]


. From the Ransomware protection strategies page, select *Add*. 
+
image:screen-protection-strategy-add.png[Add strategy page showing the Snapshot section]

. Enter a new strategy name, or enter an existing name to copy it. If you enter an existing name, choose which one to copy and select *Copy*.
+
NOTE: If you choose to copy and modify an existing strategy, the service appends "_copy" to the original name. You should change the name and at least one setting to make it unique. 

. For each item, select the *Down arrow*. 

* *Detection policy*: 
** *Policy*: Choose one of the predesigned detection policies. 
** *Primary detection*: Enable ransomware detection to have the service detect potential ransomware attacks. 
** *Block file extensions*: Enable this to have the service block known suspicious file extensions. The service takes automated Snapshot copies when Primary detection is enabled. 
+
If you want to change the blocked file extensions, edit them in System Manager. 

* *Snapshot policy*: 
** *Snapshot policy name*: Enter a name for the Snapshot policy. 
** *Snapshot locking*: Enable this to use DataLock to lock the Snapshot copies on primary storage so that they cannot be modified or deleted for a certain period of time even if a ransomware attack manages its way to the backup storage destination. This is also called _immutable storage_. 
+
The period of time that the Snapshot is locked is called the DataLock Retention Period and is based on the policy schedule and retention setting that you define, plus a 14-day buffer. Any DataLock retention policy that is less than 30 days is rounded up to 30 days minimum.  
+
Snapshot copy locking is available with ONTAP 9.13.1 and later. To learn more about SnapLock, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/index.html[SnapLock in ONTAP^].
** *Snapshot schedules*: Choose schedule options, the number of Snapshot copies to keep, and select to enable the schedule. 



+
image:screen-protection-strategy-add-backups.png[Add strategy page showing the Backup section]
* *Backup policy*: 
** *Backup policy name*: Enter a new or existing name. 
** *Backup locking*: Choose this to prevent backups on secondary storage from being modified or deleted for a certain period of time. This is also called _immutable storage_. 

** *Backup schedules*: Choose schedule options for secondary storage and enable the schedule. 


. Select *Add*. 

== Add a detection policy to workloads that have Snapshot and Backup policies already

With BlueXP ransomware protection, you can assign a ransomware detection policy to workloads that already have Snapshot and Backup policies, which are managed in other NetApp products. The detection policy will not change the policies managed in other products. 

Other services, such as BlueXP backup and recovery and SnapCenter, use the following types of policies to govern workloads: 

* Policies governing Snapshots
* Policies governing replication to secondary storage
* Policies governing backups to object storage


.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection-sc-columns.png[Protection page]
. From the Protection page, select a workload, and select the *Actions* image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[Actions horizontal button] icon. 
*OR DO YOU click PROTECT instead of Actions icon???*

+
The Protect page shows the policies managed by SnapCenter Software, SnapCenter for VMware vSphere, and BlueXP backup and recovery. 

+ 
The following example shows policies managed by SnapCenter: 
+
