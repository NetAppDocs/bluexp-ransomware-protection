[.lead]
You can protect workloads against ransomware attacks by enabling workload-consistent protection or creating ransomware protection strategies in BlueXP ransomware protection. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

*How can you protect workloads?*
Protecting workloads with BlueXP ransomware protection includes the following tasks:

* Enable workload-consistent protection, which works with SnapCenter Software or SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
// BFGF - not really true anymore
//** Change the priority or importance of the workload. 
//* link:/rp-use-protect-classify.html[Scan for personally identifiable sensitive data with BlueXP classification].
* Create or manage ransomware protection strategies, which include policies that you create for snapshots, backups, and ransomware protection (known as _detection policies_).
// BFGF - detection vs protection policies 
* Import a strategy and adjust it. 
// BFGF - still true? Utilize existing BlueXP backup and recovery or SnapCenter protection
* Group file shares to make it easier for you to protect workloads rather than protect them individually. 
//* Change the name of a workload.
//* Edit a ransomware protection strategy. 
* Delete a ransomware protection strategy.

*Which services are used in protection?*
// BFGF: BlueXP ransomware protection supports existing protection policies from:

The following services can be used to manage protection policies. Protection information from these services appears in BlueXP ransomware protection: 

* BlueXP backup and recovery for file shares, VM file shares
* SnapCenter for VMware for VM datastores
* SnapCenter for Oracle and MySQL



== Protection policies
You might find it helpful to review information about the protection policies you can change and what types of policies are in a protection strategy. 

*Which protection policies can you change?*

You can change protection policies based on the workload protection you have: 

//BFGF - this changes
* *Workloads not protected by NetApp applications*: These workloads are not managed by SnapCenter, SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, or BlueXP backup and recovery. These workloads might have snapshots taken as part of ONTAP or other products. If ONTAP FPolicy protection is in place, you can change the FPolicy protection using ONTAP. 
 
* *Workloads with existing protection by NetApp applications*: These workloads have backup or snapshot policies managed by SnapCenter, SnapCenter for VMWare vSphere, or BlueXP backup and recovery.

** If snapshot or backup policies are being managed by SnapCenter, SnapCenter for VMWare, or BlueXP backup and recovery, you can continue using these services. Using BlueXP ransomware protection, you can also apply a ransomware detection policy to those workloads.
// BFGF addition? 

** If a ransomware detection policy is being managed by Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP or ARP/AI depending on the ONTAP version) and FPolicy in ONTAP, those workloads are protected and will continue to be managed by ARP and FPolicy. 

NOTE: Backup destinations are not available for workloads in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Perform backup operations using the FSx for ONTAP backup service. You set backup policies for workloads in FSx for ONTAP in AWS, not in BlueXP ransomware protection. The backup policies appear in BlueXP ransomware protection and remain unchanged from AWS. 

*Which policies are required in a ransomware protection strategy?*

The following policies are required in ransomware protection strategy: 

* Ransomware detection policy
* Snapshot policy

A backup policy is not required in the BlueXP ransomware protection strategy. 
// You can optionally use a backup policy. 



== View ransomware protection on a workload

One of the first steps in protecting workloads is viewing your current workloads and their protection status. You can see the following types of workloads: 

* Application workloads 
* VM workloads
* File share workloads
// BFGF noted in SAN - are there other options here?

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Do one of the following: 
+
* From the Data Protection pane on the Dashboard, select *View all*. 
* From the menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection.png[Protection page]
. From this page, you can view and change protection details for the workload.

NOTE: See link:#add-a-ransomware-protection-strategy[Add a ransomware protection strategy] to learn about using BlueXP ransomware protection when there's an existing protection policy through SnapCenter or BlueXP backup and recovery service.

=== Protection details on the Protection page

The Protection page shows the following information about workload protection: 


*Protection status*: A workload can show one of the following protection statuses to indicate whether a policy is applied or not: 

* *Protected*: A policy is applied. ARP (or ARP/AI depending on the ONTAP version) is enabled on all volumes related to the workload. 
* *At risk*: No policy is applied. If a workload does not have a primary detection policy enabled, it is "at risk" even if it has a snapshot and backup policy enabled. 
* *In progress*: A policy is being applied but not completed yet. 
* *Failed*: A policy is applied but is not working. 

//*Protection health*: A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

//* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and snapshot copies have been completed. 
//* *In progress*: Backups or snapshot copies are in progress. 
//* *Failed*: Backups or snapshot copies have not completed successfully. 
//* *N/A*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 

*Detection status*: A workload can have one of the following ransomware detection statuses: 

//BFGF - there's a new ransomware option
* *Learning*: A ransomware detection policy was recently assigned to the workload and the service is scanning workloads. 
* *Active*: A ransomware detection protection policy is assigned. 
* *Not set*: A ransomware detection protection policy is not assigned. 
* *Error*: A ransomware detection policy was assigned, but the service has encountered an error. 
+
TIP: When protection is enabled in BlueXP ransomware protection, alert detection and reporting begins after the ransomware detection policy status changes from Learning mode to Active mode.


*Detection policy*: The name of the ransomware detection policy appears, if one has been assigned. If the detection policy has not been assigned, "N/A" appears. 

*Snapshot and backup policies*: This column shows the snapshot and backup policies applied to the workload and the product or service that is managing those policies.  

* Managed by SnapCenter
* Managed by SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere
* Managed by BlueXP backup and recovery
* Name of ransomware protection policy that governs snapshots and backups
* None


*Workload importance*

BlueXP ransomware protection assigns an importance or priority to each workload during discovery based on an analysis of each workload. The workload importance is determined by the following snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *Important*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per hour but greater than 1 per day
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per day 

*Predefined detection policies*

You can choose one of the following BlueXP ransomware protection predefined policies, which are aligned with workload importance: 

[cols=6*,options="header",cols="10,15a,20,15,15,15" width="100%"]

== Enable application- or VM-consistent protection with SnapCenter

Enabling application- or VM-consistent protection helps you protect your application or VM workloads in a consistent manner, achieving a quiescent and consistent state to avoid potential data loss later if recovery is needed. 

This process initiates registering SnapCenter Software Server for applications or SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere for VMs using BlueXP backup and recovery. 

After you enable workload-consistent protection, you can manage protection strategies in BlueXP ransomware protection. The protection strategy includes the snapshot and backup policies managed elsewhere along with a ransomware detection policy managed in BlueXP ransomware protection. 

To learn about registering SnapCenter or SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere using BlueXP backup and recovery, refer to the following information:  

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-register-snapcenter-server.html[Register SnapCenter Server Software^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/task-register-snapCenter-plug-in-for-vmware-vsphere.html[Register SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere^]

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Dashboard*.
. From the Recommendations pane, locate one of the following recommendations and select *Review and fix*:

. Return to BlueXP ransomware protection. 

. From BlueXP ransomware protection, go the Dashboard and initiate the discover process again. 

. From BlueXP ransomware protection, select *Protection* to view the Protection page. 

. Review details in the snapshot and backup policies column on the Protection page to see that the policies are managed elsewhere. 



== Add a ransomware protection strategy
//BFGF - reword: Adding a ransomware protection strategy to workloads creates a point of recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. 

//[IMPORTANT] Prior to the Jule 2025 BlueXP ransomware protection, how you added ransomware strategies depending on the existing protection level. With the July 2025 release, the workflow has been streamline. 

BlueXP ransomware protection supports working with existing snapshot and backup policies or enabling protection strategies. 

* **Create a ransomware protection strategy if you have no snapshot or backup policies.**
+
The ransomware protection policy includes:

** Snapshot policy 
** Ransomware detection policy
// creates a ransomware detection policy, which enables snapshots, and FPolicy. 
// If you have an existing backup 

*  **Replace the existing snapshot or backup policies from SnapCenter or BlueXP ransomware protection with strategies managed by BlueXP ransomware protection**
+
The ransomware protection policy includes:

** Snapshot policy 
** Ransomware detection policy

* *Create a detection policy for workloads that already have snapshot and backup policies*, which are managed in other NetApp products or services. The detection policy will not change the policies managed in other products.
+
The detection policy enables Autonomous Ransomware Protection and FPolicy protection if they are already activated in other services. Learn more about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection^], link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/index.html[BlueXP backup and recovery^], and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nas-audit/two-parts-fpolicy-solution-concept.html[ONTAP FPolicy^].

// Ransomware policy can supplant the existing policy

// BFGF
=== Create a ransomware protection strategy (if you have no snapshot or backup policies)

If snapshot or backup policies do not exist on the workload, you can create a ransomware protection strategy, which can include the following policies that you create in BlueXP ransomware protection: 

* Snapshot policy 
* Backup policy 
* Ransomware detection policy


.Steps to create a ransomware protection strategy [[steps]]

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection.png[Manage strategy page]

. From the Protection page, select a workload then select *Protect*. 
+
image:screen-protection-strategy.png[Manage strategies]


. From the Ransomware protection strategies page, select *Add*. 
+
image:screen-protection-strategy-add.png[Add strategy page showing the snapshot section]

. Enter a new strategy name, or enter an existing name to copy it. If you enter an existing name, choose which one to copy and select *Copy*.
+
NOTE: If you choose to copy and modify an existing strategy, the service appends "_copy" to the original name. You should change the name and at least one setting to make it unique. 

. For each item, select the *Down arrow*. 

* *Detection policy*: 
** *Policy*: Choose one of the predesigned detection policies. 
** *Primary detection*: Enable ransomware detection to have the service detect potential ransomware attacks. 
** *Block file extensions*: Enable this to have the service block known suspicious file extensions. The service takes automated snapshot copies when Primary detection is enabled. 
+
If you want to change the blocked file extensions, edit them in System Manager. 

* *Snapshot policy*: 
** *Snapshot policy base ame*: Select a policy or select *Create* and enter a name for the snapshot policy. 
** *Snapshot locking*: Enable this to lock the snapshot copies on primary storage so that they cannot be modified or deleted for a certain period of time even if a ransomware attack manages its way to the backup storage destination. This is also called _immutable storage_. This enables quicker restore time. 
+
When a snapshot is locked, the volume expiration time is set to the expiration time of the snapshot copy. 
+
Snapshot copy locking is available with ONTAP 9.12.1 and later. To learn more about SnapLock, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/index.html[SnapLock in ONTAP^].
** *Snapshot schedules*: Choose schedule options, the number of snapshot copies to keep, and select to enable the schedule. 
//+
//image:screen-protection-strategy-add-backups.png[Add strategy page showing the Backup section]
* *Backup policy*: 
** *Backup policy basename*: Enter a new or choose an existing name. 
//** *Backup locking*: Choose this to prevent backups on secondary storage from being modified or deleted for a certain period of time. This is also called _immutable storage_. 

** *Backup schedules*: Choose schedule options for secondary storage and enable the schedule. 

+
TIP: To enable backup locking on secondary storage, configure your backup destinations using the *Settings* option. For details, see link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure settings].

. Select *Add*. 

=== Add a policy to workloads that already have snapshot and backup policies

BlueXP ransomware protection enables you to assign either a detection policy or a protection policy to workloads with existing snapshot and backup protection managed in other NetApp products or services. Other services, such as BlueXP backup and recovery and SnapCenter, use policies that govern snapshots, replication to secondary storage, or backups to object storage. 

Before adding a policy to workloads with existing policies, understand the following distinctions between detection and protection policies. 

// BFGF move this
. **Detection policies** alert you to ransomware threats but do not provide additional protection. Adding a _detection_ policy doesn't change the policies managed in other products.
. **Protection policies** support replication of the workload managed by BlueXP ransomware protection. Protection policies can include snapshots, replication to secondary storage, or backups. Adding a _protection_ policy replaces existing snapshot and backup policies. 

// BFGF retitle 
==== Add a detection policy 

.Steps
. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection.png[Manage strategy page]

. From the Protection page, select a workload then select *Protect*. 
// BFGF changes
. BlueXP ransomware protection detects if there are existing active SnapCenter or BlueXP backup and recovery policies.
. To leave your existing BlueXP backup and recovery or SnapCenter policies in place and only apply a _detection_ policy, leave the **Replace existing policies** box unchecked.
. To see details of the SnapCenter policies, select the *Down arrow*.
+
Select a detection policy then select **Protect**. 
. On the Protection page, review the **Detection status** to confirm detection is Active.  

// BFGF rename

// BFGF

. In the Policies page, select the down arrow for the policy you want to assign to review the details. 

. Select the policy you want to assign.

. Select *Protect* to complete the change.


== Group file shares for easier protection 

Grouping file shares in a protection group makes it easier to protect your data estate. The service can protect all volumes in a group at the same time rather than protect each volume separately. 

You can create groups regardless of their protection status (that is, groups that are not protected and groups that are protected). When you add a protection policy to a protection group, the new protection policy replaces any existing policy, including policies managed by BlueXP backup and recovery and SnapCenter. 
// BFGF

.Steps
. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
