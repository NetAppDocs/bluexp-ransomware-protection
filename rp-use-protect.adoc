[.lead]
You can protect workloads against ransomware attacks by completing the following actions using BlueXP ransomware protection. 

* View existing workload protection. 
* Change the name of a workload for workloads (such as applications and VM datastores) not managed in SnapCenter.
* Assign a policy to a workload.
* Change the priority or importance of the workload. 
** Increase application protection to prevent future ransomware attacks.
** Change the protection for a workload that was previously protected in the service.
* Manage policies (only the ones that you created).



BlueXP ransomware protection assigns a priority to each workload during discovery. The workload priority is determined by the following Snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *Important*: Snapshot copies taken less than 1 per day but greater than 1 per hour
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies taken more than 1 per day 

*Protection status*: A workload can show one of the following protection statuses to indicate whether a policy is applied or not: 

* *Protected*: A policy is applied. 
* *At risk*: No policy is applied. 
* *In progress*: A policy is being applied but not completed yet. 
* *Failed*: A policy is applied but is not working. 

*Protection health*: A workload can have one of the following protection health statuses: 

* *Healthy*: The workload has protection enabled and backups and Snapshot copies have been completed. 
* *In progress*: Backups or Snapshot copies are in progress. 
* *Failed*: Backups or Snapshot copies have not completed successfully. 
* *N/A*: Protection is not enabled or sufficient on the workload. 


== View workload ransomware protection 

One of the first steps in protecting workloads is viewing your current workloads and their protection status. You can see the following types of workloads: 

* Application workloads 
* VM workloads
* File share workloads


.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Do one of the following: 
+
* From the Data Protection pane on the Dashboard, select *View all*. 
* From the menu, select *Protection*.
+

. From this page, you can view protection details for the workload.

//. To see file share workloads, select the *File share workloads* tab. 
// * To see application workloads, select the *Application workloads* tab. 

== View workload protection details

Reviewing protection details helps you assess the protection status that you currently have along with the workload priority, current protection policy, information about the workload itself, and storage information. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
+
image:screen-protection-details.png[Workload details from the Protection page]
. From the workload details page, you can assign a policy to a workload, change a workload name or priority, view alerts, view backup destinations, and view recovery information.


== Change the workload name

You might want to change the name of a workload for workloads (such as applications and VM datastores) not managed in SnapCenter.

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
. Click the *Pencil* image:button_pencil.png[Pencil] icon next to the workload name. 
. Change the name. 


== Change the workload priority

If the importance of the workload changes or is different than the assigned priority, you can change it. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
. Click the *Pencil* image:button_pencil.png[Pencil] icon next to the workload priority. 
. Change the priority. 

== View workload backup destinations

Within the workload details, you can quickly review the configured backup destinations.  

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. From the Protection page, select a workload. 
. In the Protection pan, click the *View backup destination*.
+
A list of configured backup destinations appears. 
For details, see link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure protection settings].

== Assign a predefined protection policy to workloads

To help protect your data, you can assign an existing ransomware protection policy to one or more workloads. You can also assign a different policy to a workload that already has a policy.

BlueXP ransomware protection includes the following predefined policies that are aligned with workload priority: 


[cols=6*,options="header",cols="10,15a,20,15,15,15" width="100%"]
|===
| Policy level

.4+| *Critical workload policy* | Quarter hourly | Every 15 min | 3 | 288 | 309 
 | Daily  | Every 1 day | 14 | 14 | 309 
 | Weekly | Every 1 week | 35 | 5 | 309

 | Daily | Every 1 day | 14 | 14 | 93  
 | Weekly | Every 1 week | 35 | 5  | 93 
 | Monthly | Every 30 days | 60 | 2 | 93

.Steps 


. From BlueXP ransomware protection, do one of the following: 
+
* From the Data Protection pane on the Dashboard, select *View all*. 
* From the Recommendation pane on the Dashboard, select a recommendation about assigning a policy and select *Review and fix*. 
* From the menu, select *Protection*.

. From the Protection page, review the workloads and select *Protect* (for VM-based or file share workloads, select *Edit protection*) next to the workload. 
+
The workload details page appears. 
+
image:screen-protection-details.png[Workload details from the Protection page]

. From the workload details page, to assign a policy, click *Edit protection*. 
+
A list of policies appears and opens to the currently assigned policy. 

. To see details, click the *Down arrow* on a policy.

+
image:screen-protection-policy-details.png[Protection policy details]


. Select a policy to assign to the workload. 


. Review the Dashboard Recommended actions pane, which shows the action as â€œCompleted."

== Create a protection policy 

If the existing policies do not meet your business needs, you can create a new protection policy. You can create your own from scratch or use an existing policy and modify its settings. 

You can create policies that govern primary and secondary storage and treat primary and secondary storage the same or differently. 

You can create a policy when you are managing all policies or during the process of reviewing a specific workload. 

.Steps to create a policy during policy management


. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
+
image:screen-protection2.png[Protection page]

. From the Protection page, select *Manage policies*. 
+
image:screen-protection-policy-manage2.png[Manage policies page]


. From the Manage policies page, select *Add*. 
+
image:screen-protection-policy-add2.png[Add policy page]

. Enter a new policy name, or enter an existing policy name to copy it. If you enter an existing policy name, choose which policy to copy.
+
NOTE: If you choose to copy and modify an existing policy, you must change at least one setting to make it unique. 

. For each item, select the *Down arrow*. 

* *Primary storage*: 
** *Snapshot copy schedules*: Choose schedule options, the number of Snapshot copies to keep, and select to enable the schedule. 
** *Primary detection*: Enable the service to detect ransomware incidents on primary storage. 
//** *Lock Snapshot copies**: Enable this to have the service lock the Snapshot copies on primary storage so that they cannot be modified or deleted for a certain period of time even if a ransomware attack manages its way to the backup storage destination. This is also called _immutable storage_. 

** *Block file extensions*: Enable this to have the service block known suspicious file extensions. The service takes automated Snapshot copies when Primary detection is enabled. 

* *Secondary storage*: 
** *Backup schedules*: Choose schedule options for secondary storage and enable the schedule. 
** *Secondary detection*: Enable the service to detect ransomware incidents on secondary storage. 

** *Lock backups*: Choose this to prevent backups on secondary storage from being modified or deleted for a certain period of time. This is also called _immutable storage_. 
+
This option uses NetApp DataLock technology, which locks backups on secondary storage. The period of time that the backup file is locked (and retained) is called the DataLock Retention Period. It is based on the backup policy schedule and retention setting that you defined, plus a 14-day buffer. Any DataLock retention policy that is less than 30 days is rounded up to 30 days minimum.

. Select *Add*.
