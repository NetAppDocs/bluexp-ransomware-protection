=== Support for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP 

This release supports Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. This feature helps you protect your FSx for ONTAP workloads with BlueXP ransomware protection.

The following changes are made to the BlueXP ransomware protection workflow:

* Discovery will include FSx for ONTAP workloads.
* The Protection tab shows FSx for ONTAP workloads. You set backup policies in AWS. You do not set backup policies for FSx for ONTAP using BlueXP ransomware protection; they appear in BlueXP ransomware protection and remain unchanged from AWS. 
* Alert incidents show the new FSx for ONTAP working environment.
