== Recover a workload 

Using BlueXP ransomware protection, the storage administrator can determine how best to recover workloads either from the recommended restore point or their preferred restore point.  

The security storage admin can recover data at different levels: 

* Recovery all volumes 
* Recover an application at the volume level or file and folder level. 
* Recover a file share at the volume level, directory, or file/folder level. 
* Recover from a datastore at a VM level.

The process differs slightly depending on the workload type.

. Review the workload information in the *Recovery* page.  

. Select a workload that is in the “Restore needed” state.
