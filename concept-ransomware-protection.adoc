Ransomware attacks can block access to your systems and data and attackers can ask for ransom in exchange for the release of data or decryption. According to the IDC, it is not uncommon for victims of ransomware to experience multiple ransomware attacks. The attack can disrupt access to your data between one day and several weeks. 

BlueXP ransomware protection is an orchestration service for ransomware protection, detection, and recovery. For the preview version, the service protects application-based workloads on on-premises NAS storage across all BlueXP accounts and working environments and backs up data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure cloud storage. 

The preview version of this service protects application-based workloads of Oracle, MySQL, VM data stores, and file shares. 

BlueXP ransomware protection encompasses the following strategies:

* *Identify* all application-based workloads in NetApp on-premises, NAS working environments in BlueXP, across all BlueXP accounts, workspaces, and BlueXP Connectors. The service then categorizes the data priority and provides recommendations to you for ransomware protection improvements.

* *Protect* high priority data by creating an immutable backup in AWS or Azure Blob cloud storage. 

* *Detect* data anomalies using AI technologies in secondary cloud storage that might result in ransomware attacks. 

* *Respond* to potential ransomware attacks by automatically initiating a tamperproof NetApp Snapshot copy that is locked so that the copy cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously (with cloud-based DataLock features enabled). With cloud-based NetApp DataLock enabled, your backup data will stay immutable and protected end to end from ransomware attacks, both at the source and in the destination.

For details about DataLock, refer to https://bluexp.netapp.com/blog/cbs-blg-cloud-backup-datalock-a-new-way-to-keep-backup-data-immutable[a blog about a new way to keep backup data immutable].

* *Recover* data in the event of an attack to accelerate application uptime by orchestrating several NetApp technologies.

== What you can do with BlueXP ransomware protection 

The BlueXP ransomware protection service provides you with full use of several NetApp technologies so that your data security administrator or security operations engineer can accomplish the following goals:

* View ransomware protection on all your workloads at a glance.
* Gain insight into ransomware protection recommendations and act on them.
* Create and assign ransomware protection policies to protect your workloads.
* Protect top workloads and high-risk data against ransomware attacks.
* Monitor the health of your workloads against ransomware attacks looking for data anomalies.
* Quickly assess the impact of ransomware incidents on your workload. 
* Mark the data in ransomware incidents as ready for your storage administrator to recover. 

Using BlueXP ransomware protection, your storage administrator can: 

* Recover from ransomware incidents intelligently by restoring data and ensuring that reinfection from stored data does not occur. This involves the use of NetApp SnapMirror and Snapshot technologies and NetApp recovery services, such as BlueXP backup and recovery (Cloud Backup), SnapCenter, SnapRestore, and BlueXP digital advisor (formerly Active IQ). 

== Benefits of using BlueXP ransomware protection 

BlueXP ransomware protection offers the following benefits: 

* Discovers workloads and datasets, classifies them, and ranks their relative importance
* Evaluates your ransomware protection posture and displays it in an easy-to-understand dashboard
* Applies AI/ML-driven data protection recommendations with one-click access
* Protects data in top application-based workloads, such as Oracle, VMware datastores and file-shares (later next quarter: VMware VMs, Oracle, MS SQL or MySQL and SAP HANA)
* Detects ransomware attacks on data in real time on primary and secondary storage using AI technology.
* Initiates automated actions in response to detected potential attacks by creating tamperproof Snapshot copies and initiating alerts about abnormal activity.
* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. BlueXP ransomware protection orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including BlueXP backup and recovery (formerly Cloud Backup), SnapCenter, SnapRestore, and AIQ. 

== Ransomware protection best practices

BlueXP ransomware protection provides specific recommendations based on your data. Generally, you should follow these best practices to protect against ransomware attacks.

* Use strong passwords in the admin accounts.
* Enable multi-factor authentication in storage accounts.
* Keep your software up to date. The service will check ONTAP versions on all nodes and recommend upgrading, when appropriate.
* Ensure that backup services are enabled, and you have at least one policy configured for backups.
* Identify policies that do not have enough protections configured, as in the following examples:
** Retention is too short based on the criticality of the data.
** No backups are configured against the policy.
** Backups do not have DataLock enabled.
* Watch for an abnormal increase in the percentage of encrypted files in a data source.
* Enable auditing so you can track information such as folder permission changes, failed attempts to read or write files, and file creations, modifications, and deletions. 
* Protect volumes in your working environment against modification and deletion on WORM storage. 
* Categorize data and protect workloads in a way that matches the data priority: Critical, important, and standard data workloads.  
* Respond to detections within 24 hours.
* Provide a descriptive name for your workload.
* Investigate backup job failures. 

== Cost 

NetApp doesnâ€™t charge you for using the Preview version of BlueXP ransomware protection.

== Licensing 

The BlueXP ransomware protection preview does not require any special licensing.  All preview licenses will be Evaluation licenses.  

BlueXP ransomware protection uses the NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection technology, which requires an ONTAP license, depending on the version of ONTAP you are using. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview] for details. 

== How BlueXP ransomware protection works

At a high-level, BlueXP ransomware protection works like this:

* *Identify*: The preview version of this service discovers data in Oracle, MySQL, VMware datastores and file-share workloads. The service discovers all customer data in NetApp on-premises, NAS working environments across all BlueXP accounts, workspaces, and BlueXP Connectors, beyond just the BlueXP Connector currently shown in the UI. Then, the service identifies the top application workloads as business Critical, Important, or Standard priority. With this service, you can drill into each workload to see associated volumes. 
+
This activity employs BlueXP digital advisor (formerly Active IQ), Active IQ Unified Manager, and NetApp Cloud Data Sense technologies. 

* *Protect*: Using BlueXP ransomware protection, you can quickly determine which workloads are at risk or protected. Using the service and NetApp SnapLock technology orchestrated by this service, a data security admin can initiate protection of top workload data to make an immutable backup, with a secure configuration and in a different security domain.

* *Detect*: The service uses AI-based anomaly detection to detect potential ransomware incidents quickly by volume.

* *Respond*:* In response to potential ransomware attacks, the service initiates a tamperproof Snapshot with Object Lock features enabled. 

* *Recover*: The BlueXP ransomware protection service orchestrates the rapid recovery of data to accelerate application uptime, orchestrating several NetApp technologies such as BlueXP backup and recovery, SnapCenter, SnapRestore, and Snapshot copies.
