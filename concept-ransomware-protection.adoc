Ransomware attacks can block access to your systems and data and attackers can ask for ransom in exchange for the release of data or decryption. According to the IDC, it is not uncommon for victims of ransomware to experience multiple ransomware attacks. The attack can disrupt access to your data between one day and several weeks. 

BlueXP ransomware protection is an orchestration service for ransomware protection, detection, and recovery. For the preview version, the service protects application-based workloads of Oracle, MySQL, VM datastores, and file shares on on-premises NAS storage (using the NFS protocol) across BlueXP accounts and backs up data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage. 


BlueXP ransomware protection encompasses the following strategies:

* *Identify* all application-based, file-share, or VMware-managed workloads in NetApp on-premises, NAS with NFS working environments in BlueXP, across BlueXP accounts, workspaces, and BlueXP Connectors. The service then categorizes the data priority and provides recommendations to you for ransomware protection improvements.

* *Protect* high priority data by creating a backup in AWS cloud storage. 

* *Detect* data anomalies that might result in ransomware attacks. 

//* *Respond* to potential ransomware attacks by automatically initiating a tamper-proof NetApp Snapshot that is locked so that the copy cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously (with cloud-based DataLock features enabled). With cloud-based NetApp DataLock enabled, your backup data will stay immutable and protected end to end from ransomware attacks at the source and in the destination.

* *Respond* to potential ransomware attacks by automatically initiating a NetApp Snapshot.

//For details about DataLock, refer to https://bluexp.netapp.com/blog/cbs-blg-cloud-backup-datalock-a-new-way-to-keep-backup-data-immutable[a blog about a new way to keep backup data immutable^].

* *Recover* data in the event of an attack to accelerate application uptime by orchestrating several NetApp technologies.

== What you can do with BlueXP ransomware protection 

The BlueXP ransomware protection service provides full use of several NetApp technologies so that your data security administrator or security operations engineer can accomplish the following goals:

* View ransomware protection on all your workloads at a glance.
* Gain insight into ransomware protection recommendations
* Improve protection posture based on BlueXP ransomware protection recommendations.
* Assign ransomware protection policies to protect your top workloads and high-risk data against ransomware attacks.
* Monitor the health of your workloads against ransomware attacks looking for data anomalies.
* Quickly assess the impact of ransomware incidents on your workload. 
* Recover from ransomware incidents intelligently by restoring data and ensuring that reinfection from stored data does not occur. 

== Benefits of using BlueXP ransomware protection 

BlueXP ransomware protection offers the following benefits: 

* Discovers workloads and datasets, classifies them, and ranks their relative importance.
* Evaluates your ransomware protection posture and displays it in an easy-to-understand dashboard.
* Applies AI/ML-driven data protection recommendations with one-click access.
* Protects data in top application-based workloads, such as MySQL, Oracle, VMware datastores and file-shares. 
* Detects ransomware attacks on data in real time on primary storage using AI technology.
* Initiates automated actions in response to detected potential attacks by creating Snapshot copies and initiating alerts about abnormal activity.
* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. BlueXP ransomware protection orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including BlueXP backup and recovery (formerly Cloud Backup), and SnapCenter.

== Ransomware protection best practices

BlueXP ransomware protection provides specific recommendations based on your data. Generally, you should follow these best practices to protect against ransomware attacks.

* Keep your software up to date. The service will check ONTAP versions on all nodes and recommend upgrading, when appropriate.
* Ensure policies have enough protections, as in the following examples citing more is needed:
** Retention is too short based on the criticality of the data.
** No backups are configured against the policy.
* Protect volumes in your working environment against modification and deletion on WORM storage. 
* Categorize data and protect workloads in a way that matches the data priority: critical, important, and standard data workloads.  
* Respond to detections within 24 hours.
* Provide a descriptive name for your workload.
* Investigate backup job failures. 

== Cost 

NetApp doesnâ€™t charge you for using the preview version of BlueXP ransomware protection.

== Licensing 

The BlueXP ransomware protection preview itself does not require any special licensing.  All preview licenses are Evaluation licenses.  

BlueXP ransomware protection uses the NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection technology, which requires an ONTAP license, depending on the version of ONTAP you are using. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^] for details. 

The preview version of this service requires a BlueXP backup and recovery service license. 

== How BlueXP ransomware protection works

At a high-level, BlueXP ransomware protection works like this.

| Feature
| Description


| *IDENTIFY* | * Finds all customer data on-premises NAS connected to BlueXP.
 * Identifies customer data from ONTAP and SnapCenter service APIs and associates it with workloads. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-family/[ONTAP^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/index.html[SnapCenter Software^].
 * Discovers each volume's current protection level using BlueXP backup and recovery, BlueXP digital advisor, and ONTAP services and NetApp technologies such as Autonomous Ransomware Protection, FPolicy, Backup policies, and Snapshot policies to map volume protection with workloads.
