Ransomware attacks can block access to your data and attackers can ask for ransom in exchange for the release of data or decryption. According to the IDC, it is not uncommon for victims of ransomware to experience multiple ransomware attacks. The attack can disrupt access to your data between one day and several weeks. 

BlueXP ransomware protection is a service to protect your data from ransomware. The service protects application-based workloads of Oracle, MySQL, VM datastores, and file shares on on-premises NAS storage (using the NFS and CIFS protocols) as well as Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Amazon Web Services, Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Google Cloud Platform, and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Microsoft Azure across BlueXP accounts. The service backs up data to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure cloud storage, and NetApp StorageGRID.

== What you can do with BlueXP ransomware protection 

The BlueXP ransomware protection service provides full use of several NetApp technologies so that your storage administrator, data security administrator, or security operations engineer can accomplish the following goals:

* *Identify* all application-based, file-share, or VMware-managed workloads in NetApp on-premises NAS with NFS or CIFS working environments in BlueXP, across BlueXP accounts, workspaces, and BlueXP Connectors. The service then categorizes the data priority and provides recommendations to you for ransomware protection improvements.

* *Protect* your workloads by enabling backups, Snapshot copies, and ransomware protection strategies on your data.  

* *Detect* anomalies that might be ransomware attacks.footnote:[No ransomware detection or prevention system can completely guarantee safety from a ransomware attack. While it's possible an attack might go undetected, NetApp technology acts as an important additional layer of defense.] 

* *Respond* to potential ransomware attacks by automatically initiating a tamper-proof NetApp ONTAP Snapshot that is locked so that the copy cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously. Your backup data will stay immutable and protected end to end from ransomware attacks at the source and in the destination.


* *Recover* your workloads that help accelerate workload uptime by orchestrating several NetApp technologies. You can choose to recover specific volumes. The service provides recommendations on the best options. 

* *Govern*: Implement your ransomware protection strategy and monitor the outcomes.

== Benefits of using BlueXP ransomware protection 

BlueXP ransomware protection offers the following benefits: 

* Discovers workloads and their existing snapshot and backup schedules, and ranks their relative importance.
* Evaluates your ransomware protection posture and displays it in an easy-to-understand dashboard.
* Provides recommendations on next steps based on discovery and protection posture analysis. 
* Applies AI/ML-driven data protection recommendations with one-click access.
* Protects data in top application-based workloads, such as MySQL, Oracle, VMware datastores and file-shares. 
* Detects ransomware attacks on data in real time on primary storage using AI technology.
* Initiates automated actions in response to detected potential attacks by creating Snapshot copies and initiating alerts about abnormal activity.
* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. BlueXP ransomware protection orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including BlueXP backup and recovery (formerly Cloud Backup) and SnapCenter. 
* Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to govern access to features and operations in the service, which enhances security. 

//* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. BlueXP ransomware protection orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including BlueXP backup and recovery (formerly Cloud Backup), SnapCenter, SnapRestore, and AIQ.


== Cost 
NetApp doesn’t charge you for using the trial version of BlueXP ransomware protection. 

//NetApp doesn’t charge you for using the trial version of BlueXP ransomware protection. The full version of BlueXP ransomware protection can be used with a NetApp license or an AWS subscription.


If you have both BlueXP backup and recovery and BlueXP ransomware protection, any common data protected by both products will be billed by BlueXP ransomware protection only.


After you purchase a license or PayGo subscription, any workload that has a ransomware detection policy (Autonomous Ransomware Protection) enabled (discovered or set by BlueXP ransomware protection), and at least one snapshot or backup policy, BlueXP ransomware protection classifies it “Protected” and it counts against purchased capacity or the PayGo subscription. If a workload is discovered without a detection policy (ARP) even if it has backup or snapshot policies, it is classified “At risk” and it does _not_ count against purchased capacity. 

Protected workloads count against purchased capacity or the subscription after the 90-day trial period ends. BlueXP ransomware protection is charged on a per GB basis for the data associated with protected workloads before efficiencies. 

== Licensing 

With BlueXP ransomware protection, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription soon, or bring your own license.

//With BlueXP ransomware protection, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license.

The BlueXP ransomware protection service requires a NetApp ONTAP license. 

//NOTE: The general release of BlueXP ransomware protection, unlike the Preview release, includes a license for NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection technology. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^] for details. 

The BlueXP ransomware protection license does not include additional NetApp products. BlueXP ransomware protection can use BlueXP backup and recovery even if you don't have a license for it. 

For details, see link:rp-start-licenses.html[Set up licensing].

== How BlueXP ransomware protection works

At a high-level, BlueXP ransomware protection works like this.

BlueXP ransomware protection uses BlueXP backup and recovery to discover and set snapshot and backup policies for file share workloads, and SnapCenter or SnapCenter for VMware to discover and set snapshot and backup policies for application and VM workloads. In addition, BlueXP ransomware protection uses BlueXP backup and recovery and SnapCenter / SnapCenter for VMware to perform file- and workload-consistent recovery.

* Identifies customer data from ONTAP and SnapCenter service APIs and associates it with workloads. Learn more about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-family/[ONTAP^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/index.html[SnapCenter Software^].

 * Discovers each volume's current protection level of NetApp Snapshot copies and backup policies as well as any on-box detection capabilities. The service then associates this protection posture with the workloads by using BlueXP backup and recovery, ONTAP services, and NetApp technologies such as Autonomous Ransomware Protection, FPolicy, Backup policies, and Snapshot policies.
