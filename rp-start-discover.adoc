To use BlueXP ransomware protection, the service needs to first discover data. During discovery, BlueXP ransomware protection analyzes all volumes and files in working environments across all BlueXP Connectors and workspaces within an account. 

NOTE: For the preview version, BlueXP ransomware protection assesses MySQL applications, Oracle applications, VMware datastores, and file shares. 

The service assesses the existing protection level including the current backup protection, Snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. Based on the assessment, the service then recommends how to improve your ransomware protection. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Select *Discover workloads* from the initial landing page. 
+
The service discovers workload data and shows the health of data protection in the Dashboard.

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when youâ€™re not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, BlueXP Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications.
