[.lead]
To use BlueXP ransomware protection, the service needs to first discover data. During discovery, BlueXP ransomware protection analyzes all volumes and files in working environments across all BlueXP Connectors and projects within an organization. 

BlueXP ransomware protection assesses MySQL applications, Oracle applications, VMware datastores, and file shares. 

NOTE: Workloads with volumes that use FlexGroup or iSCSI will not be discovered. Workloads on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP or on Azure NetApp Files are not supported. BlueXP ransomware protection reports on unsupported volumes on the Dashboard after the discovery process. 

The service assesses the existing protection level including the current backup protection, snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. Based on the assessment, the service then recommends how to improve your ransomware protection. 

You can do the following: 

* Within each Connector, select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. You might benefit from this feature if you want to protect specific workloads in your environment and not others. 
//* During workload discovery, you can enable automatic discovery of workloads per Connector. This feature lets you select the workloads that you want to protect. 
* Discover newly created workloads for previously selected working environments. 



== Select workloads to discover and protect
Within each Connector, select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
+
If this is your first time logging in to this service, the landing page appears.

. From the initial landing page, select *Start by discovering workloads*. 
+
The service finds working environments in your BlueXP Connectors. 
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes.
+

//. Do one of the following: 
//* To select working environments for all Connectors, select *Select all working environments*.
. To discover workloads for a specific Connector, select *Find new working environments* next to the Connector where you want to discover workloads.
+
A list of working environments appears.

. Select the working environments where you want to discover workloads or select the box at the top of the table to discover workloads in all discovered workload environments. 
//. Optionally, select *Enable autodiscovery* to have BlueXP ransomware protection automatically discover new workloads in the selected Connector. 
. Select *Discover*. 
+
The service discovers workload data only for those Connectors with selected working environments.
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes.

. To download the list of discovered workloads, select *Download results (CSV)*.

. To display the BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard, select *Go to Dashboard*.   
+
The Dashboard shows the health of data protection. The number of at risk or protected workloads increases based on the newly discovered workloads.

== Discover newly created workloads for previously selected working environments

If you have already selected working environments for discovery, you can discover newly created workloads for those environments from the Dashboard.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. To identify the date of the last discovery, from the Dashboard, look at the date and time stamp next to *Refresh* icon at the top right.

. From the Dashboard, select the *Refresh icon* which initiates discovery of new workloads. 


== Discover new working environments

If you have already discovered working environments, you can discover any newly created working environments or working environments that you did not previously select during previous discovery processes.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
//. Do one of the following: 
//* From the Dashboard, select *Add new* and in the tooltip that appears, select *Add new working environments*. 
. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*. 

. In the Workload discovery card, select *Discover workloads*.
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes as indicated by an in-process loading icon.

//== Enable automatic discovery of workloads per Connector

//After you set up the first workload discovery, you can set up automatic discovery of workloads per Connector.

//.Steps

//. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
//+
//The Dashboard appears. 
//+
//image:screen-dashboard.png[BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard]

//. From the top right of the Dashboard, select *Discover workloads*. 

//. Locate a Connector that displays the *Find new working environments* link.  
//+
//image:screen-discover-workloads-newly-discovered.png[Newly discovered working environments screenshot]

//. Select *Enable autodiscovery* to have BlueXP ransomware protection automatically discover new workloads in the selected Connector. 

//. Select *Discover*. 

//== Set up email notifications 

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when youâ€™re not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP organization, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, BlueXP Organization admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. 

//For instructions on configuring email settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#set-email-notification-settings[Configure email settings in BlueXP^]
