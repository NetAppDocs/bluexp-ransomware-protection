* View ransomware protection on all your workloads at a glance.
* Gain insight into ransomware protection recommendations
* Improve protection posture based on BlueXP ransomware protection recommendations.
* Assign ransomware protection policies to protect your top workloads and high-risk data against ransomware attacks.
* Monitor the health of your workloads against ransomware attacks looking for data anomalies.
* Quickly assess the impact of ransomware incidents on your workload. 
* Recover from ransomware incidents intelligently by restoring data and ensuring that reinfection from stored data does not occur.
